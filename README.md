# Carbon Clicker
Carbon Clicker is a game heavily inspired by the Cookie Clicker online game.
This game is meant to teach people about sustainability and the environment while being entertaining and fun.

This project was created by Alex (me), Kenneth, Thomas, and Andrew for the Ardsley High School Hackathon, and won the first place prize.

All code artwork in this game is original. The only modules used are standard python modules along with pygame to provide a basic GUI
from which we built onto.

## Play
Download python and use an IDE to run the main.py file. If you do not have pygame installed, do `pip install pygame` in the terminal.

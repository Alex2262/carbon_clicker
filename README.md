# Carbon Clicker
Carbon Clicker is a game heavily inspired by the Cookie Clicker online game.
This game is meant to teach people about sustainability and the environment while being entertaining and fun.
This project was created by Alex (me), Kenneth, Thomas, and Andrew for the Ardsley High School Hackathon, and won the first place prize.

## Play
